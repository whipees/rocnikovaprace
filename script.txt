Welcome to the Haunted house, you need to get out of here as soon as possible.
To escape this crazy place, you'll need to fight enemies in every of these rooms.
There are 15 rooms.
You have the ability to skip two rooms twice in this game.
You also have the ability to gain 4 health points 3 times.
Your name is Laura and you have 10 health points, on every win, you get 5 more, so it should be easy to get out of here.
If you lose, the game will restart, so play until you win haha.
